# Web-Scraping-House-Prices-in-Istanbul

This project analyzes real estate data, focusing on housing prices, area distribution, and various property attributes. The dataset was obtained through web scraping from RE/MAX TÃ¼rkiye using BeautifulSoup and Requests in Python. After extracting the data, it was cleaned, processed, and visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis provides insights into factors affecting housing prices, such as district, number of rooms, building age, and heating type.
